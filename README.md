# Sherpa

## Important тЪая╕П
After opening the project, install all needed dependencies (IDE should do it by itself).

After that, go to SherpaBackend, Properties folder and create a `launchSettings.json` based on `launchSettings.json.sample`. Ask for AWS credentials or search them in Confluence.

## To run ЁЯЪА
Go to SherpaBackend and run `dotnet run` (or `dotnet watch` for hot-reload)
