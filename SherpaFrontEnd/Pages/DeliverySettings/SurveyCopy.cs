            @"Hi team! This questionnaire is part of an overall team assessment. It focuses on describing how we are currently working as a team. The important part about this survey is not the answers themselves, but the conversations that we can have around based on the results obtained. To consider:

- It takes at least 30 min to complete
- It contains around 100 questions, most of them on a scale of 1 to 5 that represents how much you disagree (""strongly disagree"") or agree (""strongly agree"") with what was stated.
- Saving questions halfway is not allowed

Please try to be as honest as possible. Your answers are very important and will help the team.

Thank you!

- Codurance Team";
